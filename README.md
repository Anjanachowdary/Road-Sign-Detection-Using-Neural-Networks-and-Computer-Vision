# Road-Sign-Detection-Using-Neural-Networks-and-Computer-Vision
By training the CNN model successfully with the dataset of 43 classes of traffic signs, split into 39,209 training images and
12,630 test images, I was able to recognize the traffic signs correctly with an accuracy of 98.5% and build an alert system using
computer vision which detects the traffic sign and alerts the driver
